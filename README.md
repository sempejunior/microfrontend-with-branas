About
============

This project was my first live code participation and is about micro frontend architecture. The live was shown on June 30, 2021 with Rodrigo Branas. To demonstrate the architecture, 4 projects were created. First, I created the root project. This project is responsible for calling routes to other micro frontends and injecting dependencies. I created 3 other projects, 2 in react (navbar and app1) and 1 in vue (app2). In the live show I demonstrated how the micro frontend architecture works and how we can use many independent projects and frameworks in the same Dom.
